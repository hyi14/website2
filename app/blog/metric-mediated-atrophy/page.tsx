      <h1>Metric‑Mediated Atrophy</h1>
      <p><em>When teams optimize the metric instead of the mission, capability quietly withers.</em></p>
      <h2>When metrics become the map</h2>
      <p>
        Metrics are necessary, but they’re not neutral. Once a number becomes a target, it invites
        gaming, and attention shifts from creating impact to shaping the dashboard. This post
        reframes risk management as the craft of protecting mission integrity while still
        measuring what matters.

      <h2>Signals vs. scores</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Signals</strong> help you decide what to do next.</li>
        <li><strong>Scores</strong> tell you how you did, but often too late.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pair each metric with a <em>counter‑metric</em> to discourage single‑axis gaming.</li>
        <li>Track <em>leading indicators</em> of capability, not only lagging outputs.</li>
        <li>Use <em>review narratives</em> to explain the “why”, not just the “what”.</li>
      </ol>
